Hello everyone and welcome to Darwin Core Hour! My name is [name] and I am with [affiliation]. I’d like to start with a few logistics before I introduce this webinar series and our speakers for the day.

Starting with a few points about how this Zoom session is set up:
- You can edit your name, affiliation, and pronouns on your Zoom name by going to the Participant list and clicking "More" next to your name. Adding details helps everyone get to know who else is here today, so please do so.
- As you all experienced, we have enabled the waiting room to minimize the risk of zoom bombing.
Private chat and file share are disabled.
- It's probably safest to expect the unexpected (video/audio lag, freezing); let us know in the chat if you are experiencing any issues.
- Please use a headset for your audio if you plan on speaking as it reduces echo for others.
- And finally, we recommend using the Zoom desktop client or mobile app rather than Zoom in your internet browser because the client and app use less bandwidth. You can also turn off your video if you are having bandwidth issues.

We also have a few housekeeping notes about communication etiquette in Zoom:
- Your microphones are currently muted, but you can unmute yourself to ask questions or participate in discussion when we get to that point. Please return to mute after you speak.
- Feel free to participate in whatever works best for you, either verbally or through chat. During the presentation, typing your questions in the chat is a good option.
- You can raise your hand by clicking on the hand icon in the Participants list, or by typing “/hand” in the chat.
- We will try to pause in our discussion to let people who may not always jump right in contribute, so don’t be alarmed if there is “dead air.”
- Last but not least, use the shared Google Doc for notes and links. Links in the Zoom chat are no longer clickable or copy-able to minimize risks associated with zoom bombing.

Okay, now that those logistical notes are out of the way, I'd like to briefly introduce the Darwin Core Hour webinar series. One of our main goals in putting this series together is to encourage more integrated and direct collaborations between the biodiversity data and collections community together with the standards and software communities. To that extent, we have a google form where anyone–including you–can ask a question about the Darwin Core standard. You can get to this form from the link on the slide, which is also available (and clickable) in the shared Google Doc notes.

Questions asked via that form are sent to the Darwin Core Hour github repository, where we do our best to answer them. These questions and answers feed into creating better documentation for the DwC standard.

If you want to see what questions have already been asked and answered, you can do so by looking at the issues in our GitHub repo. Again, this link is also available in the shared Google Doc notes.

The wiki on this GitHub repository contains some of the improved documentation, for example, this page on georeferencing terms in Darwin Core.

If you would like to see more about how to use the Darwin Core Questions and Answers site, Paula Zermoglio has put together a brief video tutorial, which is available on the landing page of the GitHub repository. Again, see the shared Google Doc for a link.

Alright, well without further ado, I would like to introduce the [edition #] of the Darwin Core Hour webinar series: [title]. Here to present we have [presenter/s] from [affilitation]. I will turn the screen over to them now.

START RECORDING!!!
